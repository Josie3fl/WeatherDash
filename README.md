## Description

I wanted to created an aplication that was able to collect data from an actual weather platform and display your current city weather, 
with the capacity of showing at the same time a forecast for the next five days. While building this aplication there were a lot of challenges for me in particular was building the for loop at one point for the buildForecastArray function. There were other major challanges like how to make sure that the back end information was reflecting in the front end. For example I had major trouble trying to show the windspeed and the temperature in the little forecast boxes. With that being said those major challenges forced me to learn better ways of jumping through my code like hot keys such and "ctrl+ left click" on the function or method is giving you trouble. That it is good practice to use "ctrl f" instead of scrolling. Last but definetly not least it is very important to perform and an "npm run build" after modifying your code. I was closing my terminal and running and "npm start" after changing or modifying my code and that costed me a lot of time.

## Installation

Installation of this app is very simple simply click on the link bellow:

Or visit my repository:
